This project is designed to increase my knowledge with C, as well as increase my comfortability using weirder symbols on a keyboard. 
The idea is to have a command line based typing test that will print out a line, you write it in the terminal, and it reads the response.
I will attempt to throw in coding related words in addition to normal english, and introduce things such as bolded/italiczed/underlined text to train for google docs.
I don't know how yet, but I plan on doing it.
